# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

A collection of AI agent skills (not a runnable application) for generating high-quality unit tests. Skills are installed into target projects via `npx openskills install` or `npx skills add`. There is no build system, test suite, or application code here — only skill definitions and rule documents.

## Repository Structure

```
skills/
  generate-test-cases/    # Skill: analyze code → output test case list
    SKILL.md              # Skill definition (frontmatter + instructions)
    rules/general/        # General testing rules
  generate-tests/         # Skill: generate actual test code from cases
    SKILL.md
    rules/tests/
      general/            # General testing rules (superset of generate-test-cases rules)
      java/unit/          # Java-specific rules (JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ)
      post-generation/    # Compilation verification rules
templates/
  AGENTS-SNIPPET.md       # Template users copy into their project's AGENTS.md
```

## Available Skills

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/generate-tests <target>` | Generate unit tests for code. Handles the full workflow: analyzes code, outputs test cases for review, then generates test code. Supports Java (JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ). |
| `/generate-test-cases <target>` | Analyze code for test coverage and list needed test cases — without generating actual test code. Use for analysis-only. |

## Workflow

`/generate-tests` is the primary skill — it handles the complete workflow internally:

1. Analyzes code and outputs a structured test case list
2. Asks the user to review test cases before proceeding
3. Generates test code
4. Verifies compilation

`/generate-test-cases` is available separately for analysis-only use cases (e.g., reviewing test coverage strategy without generating code).

## Rules

Each skill's `SKILL.md` lists which rule files it reads. When a skill is invoked, the skill definition instructs the agent to read the rule files from the skill's own `rules/` directory. The `generate-tests` skill has a superset of rules (includes Java-specific and post-generation rules).

Key rule topics:
- **INCLUDE/EXCLUDE criteria** (`test-case-generation-strategy.md`) — what to test vs. skip
- **Naming** (`naming-conventions.md`) — `{method}_{state}_{outcome}` format
- **Structure** (`general-principles.md`) — Given-When-Then, `actual`/`expected` prefixes
- **Existing test awareness** (`existing-test-awareness.md`) — check for existing tests before generating; match project conventions; avoid duplicates
- **Code context analysis** (`code-context-analysis.md`) — read DTOs, entities, enums, and other dependency classes before writing tests
- **Java specifics** — JUnit 5 + Mockito + AssertJ; `@SpringBootTest` is FORBIDDEN in unit tests; use `ArgumentCaptor` to verify DTO/model fields; use `any()` only for irrelevant arguments; `@WebMvcTest` for controllers (`controller-test-rules.md`)
- **Post-generation verification** — compilation verification (`compilation-verification.md`) AND test execution verification (`test-execution-verification.md`) — tests must both compile and pass

## Plugin Distribution

This repository is also a Claude Code plugin and marketplace, declared in
`.claude-plugin/`. Users install it with:

```
/plugin marketplace add mavka-ai/unit-tests-skills
/plugin install unit-tests-skills@mavka
```

**Any change to `.claude-plugin/` or `skills/` must be validated before pushing:**

```bash
./scripts/validate-plugin.sh
```

CI enforces this on every PR touching those paths, and the community-marketplace
review pipeline runs the same `claude plugin validate` check — a failure here is
a rejected submission there.

Three non-obvious rules apply: validating the repo root does not validate
`plugin.json`, a mismatched entry name passes validation but breaks installs,
and `version` belongs in `plugin.json` only. See
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#plugin-validation) for the reasoning behind each — that
file is the single source of truth; do not duplicate its detail here.

## Contributing

- Place general rules in `rules/general/` (or `rules/tests/general/` for generate-tests)
- Place language-specific rules in `rules/tests/{language}/unit/`
- **Keep general rules in sync**: General rules exist in TWO locations (`generate-test-cases/rules/general/` and `generate-tests/rules/tests/general/`). When adding or updating a general rule, copy the change to both directories
- When adding a new rule, also add it to the Rules Reference list in the relevant `SKILL.md` file(s)
- **After any change under a skill's `rules/`, run `./scripts/validate-rules.sh`.** It enforces the two points above — a reference with no file, a file with no reference, and general rules that have drifted apart. CI runs it on every PR. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#rule-validation) for what each check catches; that file is the single source of truth, do not duplicate its detail here
- All changes require a PR with CODEOWNER approval; direct pushes to `main` are disabled
